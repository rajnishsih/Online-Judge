### Two Sum

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`.  
Return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution,  
and you may not use the same element twice.

**Input Format**  
- First line: An integer `n` (number of elements)  
- Second line: `n` space-separated integers  
- Third line: Target sum

**Output Format**  
- Two space-separated indices (0-based) of the elements that sum to the target

**Constraints**  
- 2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴  
- -10⁹ ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10⁹  
- -10⁹ ≤ target ≤ 10⁹
